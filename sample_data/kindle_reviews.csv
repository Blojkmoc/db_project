0,B000F83SZQ,"[0, 0]",5,I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.,"05 5, 2014",A1F6404F1VG29J,Avidreader,Nice vintage story,1399248000
1,B000F83SZQ,"[2, 2]",4,"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.","01 6, 2014",AN0N05A9LIJEQ,critters,Different...,1388966400
2,B000F83SZQ,"[2, 2]",4,"This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language.","04 4, 2014",A795DMNCJILA6,dot,Oldie,1396569600
